    <!--The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. 
    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
    It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well \-->

    <!--Besides the src attribute, every image element must also have an alt (alternative text) attribute.
    The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
    It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users-->
