    <img src="../images/nigerian_egusi_soup.webp" alt="fried rice" height="563" width="750">
    <h1>Description</h1> 
    <p><strong>Egusi soup</strong> is a rich and flavorful West African dish made primarily from ground melon seeds (egusi), 
        which give it a thick and hearty texture. It is commonly cooked with leafy vegetables such as spinach, 
        pumpkin leaves, or bitter leaf, and features a blend of spices, palm oil, and proteins like beef, goat meat, 
        fish, or crayfish. It is a staple in Nigerian cuisine and widely enjoyed across the region. </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups egusi (melon seeds), ground</li>
        <li>1 cup palm oil</li>
        <li>1 lb (about 500g) assorted meat (beef, goat meat, tripe, etc.)</li>
        <li>1 cup stockfish (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup smoked or dried fish, deboned</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground crayfish</li>
        <li>2-3 cups vegetable (pumpkin leaves, spinach, or bitter leaf)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons locust beans (iru) (optional)</li>
        <li>4 cups meat stock (or water)</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons ground pepper (or to taste)</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>If using whole egusi seeds, grind them into a fine powder using a dry mill or blender.</li>
        <li>Wash and season the assorted meat with salt, seasoning cubes, onions, and some water. 
        Boil until tender, then set aside. Soak the stockfish in warm water to soften it.</li>
        <li>Rinse and chop the vegetables of your choice (pumpkin leaves, spinach, or bitter leaf). 
            If using bitter leaf, wash thoroughly to reduce bitterness.</li>
        <li>In a pot, heat the palm oil over medium heat. Do not overheat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and locust beans (iru) if using, and saut√© for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Mix the ground egusi with a little water to form a thick paste. Add this paste into the oil in small lumps 
            and fry for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. This step enhances the flavor.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the meat stock (or water), stirring continuously to loosen the egusi. 
            Let it cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked meat, stockfish, and smoked fish, then mix well. Allow it to simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in ground crayfish, pepper, seasoning cubes, and salt to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the chopped vegetables and stir. Let it cook for another 3-5 minutes to preserve the color and nutrients.</li>
    </ol>
